I read this book over a couple of days  It was hard to put down  The things I liked best about this book were very interesting characters that made you think hard about them a plot filled with suspense to the end multiple subplots that merged well together  a lean writing style that let me focus mostly on the characters  the provocative web I found them   This is a very thougthfully crafted story I think most anyone would enjoy this novel  Highly recommended
